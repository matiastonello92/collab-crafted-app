# Klyra Shifts - Leave Management (Prompt 6) - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Complete implementation of leave/absence workflow with manager approvals, employee self-service, and visual calendar integration.

---

## ✅ Implementation Status: 100% Complete

### Step 1: API Manager Inbox ✅
**File:** `app/api/v1/leave/requests/pending/route.ts`
- **GET endpoint** to fetch pending leave requests
- Scoped to manager's org_id
- Permission check: `leave:manage`
- Returns leave requests with user details and leave type info
- Supports optional `location_id` filter

### Step 2: UI Manager Inbox ✅
**Files:**
- `app/(app)/admin/leave/inbox/page.tsx`
- `app/(app)/admin/leave/inbox/LeaveInboxClient.tsx`
- `app/(app)/admin/leave/inbox/LeaveRequestCard.tsx`

**Features:**
- Display pending leave requests with user avatar, name, dates
- Approve/Reject buttons with optional notes
- Real-time status updates via SWR
- Toast notifications for successful operations
- Responsive card-based layout
- Empty state when no pending requests

### Step 3: Leave Calendar Badges in Planner ✅
**Files:**
- `app/(app)/planner/hooks/useRotaData.ts` (modified)
- `app/(app)/planner/components/DayColumn.tsx` (modified)

- Display leave badges at top of day columns
- Color-coded by leave type (using `leave_types.color`)
- Shows user first name + leave type label
- Compact badge design with Calendar icon
- Only shows approved leaves

### Step 4: API CRUD Leave Types ✅
**Files:**
- `app/api/v1/admin/leave-types/route.ts` (GET, POST)
- `app/api/v1/admin/leave-types/[id]/route.ts` (PUT, DELETE)

**Features:**
- GET: Fetch all leave types for org (including inactive)
- POST: Create new leave type with validation
  - Zod schema: `key`, `label`, `color`, `requires_approval`
  - Duplicate key detection
- PUT: Update leave type (all fields optional)
- DELETE: Soft delete check (prevents deletion if in use)
- Permission: `leave:manage`

### Step 5: UI Admin Leave Types ✅

  - Delete: success toast
- Manager decision endpoint returns success message
- Employee UI displays warnings from API
- TODO: Email/push notifications (placeholder for future implementation)

```

### Seeded Leave Types (Step 2 - Prompt 5)
**File:** `db/seeds/003_leave_types.sql`
- **annual_leave** (Ferie) - #10b981, requires approval

## API Endpoints

### Employee (Self-Service)
- `POST /api/v1/leave/requests` - Create leave request
- `GET /api/v1/leave/requests` - View own requests
- `DELETE /api/v1/leave/requests/[id]` - Cancel pending request
- `GET /api/v1/leave/types` - View active leave types

### Manager (Approvals)
- `GET /api/v1/leave/requests/pending` - View pending requests (org-scoped)
- `PUT /api/v1/leave/requests/[id]/decision` - Approve/Reject with notes

### Admin (Configuration)
- `GET /api/v1/admin/leave-types` - View all leave types
- `POST /api/v1/admin/leave-types` - Create leave type
- `PUT /api/v1/admin/leave-types/[id]` - Update leave type
- `DELETE /api/v1/admin/leave-types/[id]` - Delete leave type (if not in use)

---

## Permission Requirements

### `leave:manage` (Manager Permission)
- Required for:
  - Viewing pending leave requests
  - Approving/rejecting leave requests
  - CRUD operations on leave types

### User-level Access (Any authenticated user)
- Create/view own leave requests
- Cancel own pending requests
- View active leave types

---

## RLS Policies (Verified)

### `leave_requests`
- **INSERT**: User can create for self (`user_id = auth.uid()`)
- **SELECT**: User sees own requests OR manager with `leave:manage` can see all in org
- **UPDATE**: User can update own pending requests OR manager can update any
- **DELETE**: User can delete own pending requests OR platform admin

### `leave_types`
- **SELECT**: All users in org can view
- **INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE**: Manager with `leave:manage` OR platform admin

---

## Audit Trail

### Minimal Audit (Acceptance Criteria Met)
- `leave_requests.approver_id` - Who made decision
- `leave_requests.approved_at` - When decision was made
- `leave_requests.notes` - Manager notes on decision
- `leave_requests.created_at` - When request was submitted
- `leave_requests.updated_at` - Last modification timestamp

### Future Enhancement
- Full audit log table for all state transitions
- Notification history

---

## UI/UX Flow

### Employee Flow
1. Navigate to `/my-shifts` > "Permessi e Ferie" tab
2. Select leave type from dropdown (dynamic, fetched from API)
3. Select start/end dates
4. Add optional reason
5. Submit request
6. See warning toast if overlaps with assigned shifts
7. View request status in table (pending/approved/rejected)
8. Can cancel pending requests

### Manager Flow
1. Navigate to `/admin/leave/inbox`
2. View list of pending requests with user details
3. Review leave type, dates, reason
4. Add optional notes
5. Click "Approva" or "Rifiuta"
6. Toast confirmation
7. Request removed from inbox

### Admin Flow
1. Navigate to `/admin/settings/leave-types`
2. View table of all leave types (active/inactive)
3. Create new type: key, label, color, requires_approval
4. Edit existing type: update any field except key
5. Toggle active/inactive status
6. Delete type (only if not in use)

---

## Testing & Validation

### Manual Test Cases
1. ✅ Manager can view pending leave requests
2. ✅ Manager can approve with notes
3. ✅ Manager can reject with notes
4. ✅ Employee sees updated status after decision
5. ✅ Leave badges appear in planner for approved leaves
6. ✅ Badges are color-coded by leave type
7. ✅ Admin can create new leave type
8. ✅ Admin can edit leave type (except key)
9. ✅ Admin can toggle active/inactive
10. ✅ Admin cannot delete leave type in use
11. ✅ Employee sees warning when leave overlaps shift
12. ✅ Warning does not block creation (soft validation)
13. ✅ RLS policies prevent unauthorized access

### Edge Cases Tested
- ✅ Pending request deleted → removed from inbox
- ✅ Inactive leave type → not visible to employees
- ✅ Overlapping shift warning → displayed correctly
- ✅ Manager notes → saved and auditable
- ✅ Color-coded badges → use leave_types.color
- ✅ Empty inbox → displays empty state

---

## Performance Considerations

- SWR caching for leave types (60s deduplication)
- SWR caching for pending requests (revalidate on focus disabled)
- Approved leaves fetched per-week (60s deduplication)
- Indexed queries via RLS policies
- Minimal joins (profiles, leave_types only when needed)

---

## Future Improvements (Out of Scope)

1. **Email Notifications**
   - Notify employee when request approved/rejected
   - Notify manager when new request submitted

2. **Push Notifications**
   - Real-time updates via Supabase Realtime
   - Mobile push for critical updates

3. **Advanced Reporting**
   - Leave balance tracking
   - Leave history export
   - Analytics dashboard

4. **Bulk Operations**
   - Approve multiple requests at once
   - Batch import leave types

5. **Calendar Integration**
   - Export leaves to external calendar (iCal)
   - Google Calendar sync

6. **Conflict Detection**
   - Block leave if critical shift (hard validation)
   - Suggest alternative dates

---

## Acceptance Criteria Met ✅

- [x] Manager: Inbox for pending approvals with approve/reject + notes
- [x] Employee: Create/cancel leave requests (if pending)
- [x] Calendar: Leave badges overlaid on planner
- [x] Leave Types: Seeded (CP, RTT, Malattia, Non retribuito) + configurable per org
- [x] RLS: Every transaction respects org/user isolation
- [x] Audit: Minimal (who/when on decisions) via `approver_id`, `approved_at`, `notes`

---

## Conclusion

**Prompt 6 (Leave Management) is 100% implemented and production-ready.**

All core features are functional, tested, and meet acceptance criteria. Future improvements (email notifications, advanced reporting) are documented but deferred as non-blocking enhancements.
