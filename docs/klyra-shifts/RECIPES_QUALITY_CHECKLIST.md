# Klyra Recipes - Quality Checklist

## ✅ Data Integrity Validations

### Client-Side (Pre-submit)
- [x] **Title:** Required, max 200 characters
- [x] **Category:** Required enum value
- [x] **Servings:** Required, integer >= 1
- [x] **Ingredients:** At least 1 with quantity > 0
- [x] **Steps:** At least 1 with non-empty instruction
- [x] **Units:** Auto-populated from `inventory_catalog_items`, read-only
- [x] **Allergens:** Multi-select from predefined list with HSL color badges
- [x] **Season:** Multi-select months (optional)

### Server-Side (Submit/Publish)
- [x] **Submit validation (`/api/v1/recipes/:id/submit`):**
  - Status must be `draft`
  - Servings >= 1
  - At least 1 ingredient with quantity > 0
  - At least 1 step with non-empty instruction
  
- [x] **Publish validation (`/api/v1/recipes/:id/publish`):**
  - Status must be `submitted`
  - All submit validations apply
  - **Photo URL required** (blocks publish if missing)
  - User must have `shifts:manage` permission

### Database Constraints
- [x] **Sub-recipe cycles:** Prevented by DB trigger (no circular dependencies)
- [x] **Units coherence:** Enforced by foreign key to `inventory_catalog_items.uom`
- [x] **Status workflow:** `draft → submitted → published → archived` (one-way transitions)

## 📊 Telemetry & Usage Tracking

### Events Logged
- [x] **Cook Mode Opened:** Logged on `/recipes/:id/cook` component mount
- [x] **Recipe Printed:** Logged on print button click (both variants: full, station)

### Data Captured
```typescript
{
  recipe_id: UUID,
  user_id: UUID,
  org_id: UUID,
  location_id: UUID,
  event_type: 'cook_mode_opened' | 'recipe_printed',
  metadata: { variant?: 'full' | 'station', servings?: number },
  created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
}
```

### Aggregated Stats (Materialized View)
- [x] `cook_count`: Total Cook Mode opens
- [x] `print_count`: Total prints
- [x] `total_uses`: Combined usage count
- [x] `last_cooked_at`: Last Cook Mode timestamp
- [x] `last_printed_at`: Last print timestamp
- [x] `last_used_at`: Most recent usage (any type)

### Frontend Integration
- [x] **Sort by "Più usate":** Available in RecipeFilters dropdown
- [x] **Performance:** Uses indexed materialized view (refreshed every 100 logs)

## 🎨 Accessibility (A11y)

### Color Contrast (WCAG AA: 4.5:1)
- [x] **Allergen badges:** HSL colors verified for sufficient contrast
- [x] **Season badges:** HSL colors verified for sufficient contrast
- [x] **Focus indicators:** All interactive elements have `focus-visible:ring-2`

### ARIA Labels
- [x] **Cook Mode Exit:** `aria-label="Esci dalla modalità cucina (Esc)"`
- [x] **Cook Mode Prev:** `aria-label="Passaggio precedente (freccia sinistra)"`
- [x] **Cook Mode Next:** `aria-label="Passaggio successivo (freccia destra)"`
- [x] **Print Button:** `aria-label="Stampa ricetta"`
- [x] **Favorite Button:** (inherited from base component)

### Keyboard Navigation
- [x] **Cook Mode:**
  - `←` Previous step
  - `→` Next step
  - `Esc` Exit to recipe detail
- [x] **Forms:** Tab order follows visual flow
- [x] **Popovers/Dialogs:** Esc to close, focus trap enabled

### Screen Reader Support
- [x] Semantic HTML (headings, lists, buttons)
- [x] Form labels associated with inputs
- [x] Error messages announced
- [x] Loading states indicated

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Create draft recipe → Submit → Publish (happy path)
- [ ] Try to publish without photo (should block)
- [ ] Try to submit with servings = 0 (should block)
- [ ] Try to submit with all ingredients having quantity = 0 (should block)
- [ ] Open Cook Mode → verify telemetry logged
- [ ] Print recipe → verify telemetry logged
- [ ] Filter by "Più usate" → verify sort order
- [ ] Filter by "In stagione ora" → verify current month filter
- [ ] Keyboard navigation in Cook Mode (←, →, Esc)
- [ ] Tab through form fields (logical order)
- [ ] Test with screen reader (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver)

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Recipe with no steps → cannot submit
- [ ] Recipe with 0 servings → cannot submit
- [ ] Sub-recipe referencing itself → DB prevents
- [ ] Extremely long title (>200 chars) → truncated/validated
- [ ] Non-contiguous season months (e.g., Jan, Jun, Dec) → badge shows "Gen–Dic"

---

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- [x] **Telemetry logging:** Fire-and-forget (doesn't block user flow)
- [x] **Materialized view:** Refreshed asynchronously (every 100 logs)
- [x] **Recipe list:** Paginated (50 per page)
- [x] **Filters:** Applied server-side (reduces payload)
- [x] **Images:** Lazy-loaded where applicable

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- [x] **RLS policies:** All recipe operations respect org/location tenancy
- [x] **Usage logs:** Users can only insert own logs, admins can view all
- [x] **Publish permission:** Requires `shifts:manage` permission
- [x] **Input sanitization:** Zod validation on all user inputs
- [x] **SQL injection:** Prevented by Supabase parameterized queries

---

## 📝 Known Limitations

1. **Telemetry refresh delay:** Stats may be stale for up to 100 new events
2. **Season badge format:** Non-contiguous months show min-max range (not all selected months)
3. **No analytics dashboard:** Usage stats available via API only (no UI yet)
4. **No edit history:** Recipes don't track change history (future enhancement)
